			Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the
			greatest blessings for human life; however, nowadays humans fail to
			recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets,
			writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation
			inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it. They truly
			valued nature which reflects in their works even today.
